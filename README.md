                      **Building a Personalized Chatbot With LangChain and Oracle Generative AI Service **

                          
This chatbot will respond to your queries  and questions related to TOGAF 10 concepts.


To learn about OCI Generative AI services ,refer to [Oracle Generative AI Certification course](https://mylearn.oracle.com/ou/course/oci-generative-ai-professional/136035/2126370) I found this course very useful for certificaiton as well as learning RAG, LLM architecture , Encoding & decoding etc. 

Below is the architecture of the RAG based chatbot -

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Generative AI is a fully managed service that provides a set of state-of-the-art, 
customizable large language models (LLMs) that cover a wide range of use cases, and which is available through a single API. 
Using the OCI Generative AI service you can access ready-to-use pretrained models, or 
create and host your own fine-tuned custom models based on your own data on dedicated AI clusters.

- In this implementation TOGAF standard and additional documents are stored in form of embeddings in Chroma vector database.
- OCI Gen AI API to access pre-trained LLM Model for embdedings and responding to user queries.
- Model name for embedding is cohere command.
- Langchan  - An opensource framework used for developing applications powered by LLMs. LangChain provides many libraries, APIs and templates to make it easy for us to develop applications powered by LLMs. LangChain integrates with OCI services , and can be used to invoke the OCI Gen AI APIs.
  
- LangSmith  - LangSmith uses traces to log almost every aspect of LLM runs. These include metrics such as latency, token count, price of runs, and all types of metadata. The Web  UI allows you to quickly filter runs based on error percentage, latency, date, or even by text content using natural language
                   
- RAG - Used for Augmeting prompt with specific context which will be the input to LLM. This chatbot uses OCI Generative AI embedding 
   models together with a Cohere command pre-trained LLM to implement a RAG pattern.
- Chroma DB - Its open source vector database, stores TOGAF PDF in terms of embedddings. when query received , get the relevant documents from vector DB and insert into prompt. Embedding model used is cohere.embed-english-v3.0
